description: Check whether a specific attachment exists in the current workflow context.
  This is a lightweight check that validates the identifier format and verifies the
  file exists on disk without loading the attachment data. This tool works at any
  accessibility level. When accessibility is not "all", a note is included indicating
  the agent cannot read attachment content.
