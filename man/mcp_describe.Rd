\title{Describe an R object for use in \verb{MCP} tools}
\usage{
mcp_describe(x, ..., max_print = 100)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{The object to describe.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed down to underlying methods. Unused
arguments are silently ignored.}

\item{max_print}{Maximum number of items to print for long objects.
Default is 100.}
}
\value{
A character vector of lines describing the object. If the object
is a simple scalar, may return a single-element character vector.
}
\description{
A generic function used to describe an R object in a way that can be
safely serialized to JSON and sent to \verb{MCP} clients. Unlike direct
serialization, this function handles special objects (environments,
external pointers, large objects) by generating human-readable descriptions.
}
\examples{
# Describe a data frame
mcp_describe(mtcars)

# Describe a function
mcp_describe(mean)

# Describe a matrix
mcp_describe(matrix(1:12, 3, 4))
