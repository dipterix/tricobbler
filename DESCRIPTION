Description: Provides a two-tier architecture for building multi-agent AI 
    workflows combining immutable policy definitions (S7 classes) with mutable 
    execution state (R6 classes). Defines workflow blueprints through master 
    policies (stages vocabulary) and state policies (stage implementations with 
    priority-based ordering), validates completeness via manifests, and 
    orchestrates runtime execution through schedulers. Supports priority-based 
    sequential execution, critical validation gates with fail-fast semantics, 
    and YAML serialization for version control. Designed for controlled and 
    reproducible AI agent orchestration with Large Language Models.
