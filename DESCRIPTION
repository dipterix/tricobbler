Title: Multi-Agent Workflow Orchestration with Immutable Policy Definitions

Description: Provides a three-tier architecture for building multi-agent AI workflows
    combining immutable policy definitions (S7 classes) with mutable execution state
    (R6 classes). Defines workflow blueprints through MasterPolicy (stages vocabulary)
    and StatePolicy (stage implementations with priority-based ordering), validates
    completeness via Manifest, creates execution agreements with Contract, and tracks
    runtime state through ContractState. Supports sequential and parallel execution
    patterns, critical validation gates with fail-fast semantics, and YAML serialization
    for version control. Designed for controlled and reproducible AI agent orchestration 
    with LLMs.
